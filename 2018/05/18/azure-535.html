            <p>A couple of weeks ago I took and passed the Microsoft Azure Architecure exam, 70-535.<br />
At work we are doing more and more Azure development and I wanted the qualification to make sure I knew all off Microsoft's offering on Azure ( and there are a well over a hundred of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/">them</a> ).</p>
<p>It's a hard exam and I found little advice on the Internet, so here are some notes for others taking the same exam.</p>
<p>My revision approach was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch Udemy video on by Scott Duffy</li>
<li>Random youtube videos on particular subjects I was struggling with ( e.g. Azure B2B vs B2C )</li>
<li>MeasureUp Test exams</li>
<li>Lots of playing around in Azure itself, creating resources, trying things out ( essential in my opinion )</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd guess my total time studying was about 80 hours.</p>
<p>Be aware the exam used to be called 70-534. It was recently updated at the start of 2018 and got the number bumped to 70-535.</p>
<h2 id="udemy-videos">Udemy videos</h2>
<p>I purchased access to Scott's 535 <a href="https://www.udemy.com/70534-azure/">videos</a> for about £20, which was pretty good for 13+ hours of content.
Generally I found it good, although with the fast pace of Azure he's obviously challenged with keeping it all up to date.</p>
<p>Scott seems to add new content all the time, so if you go this route, make sure you check for updates regularly.</p>
<h2 id="test-exams">Test exams</h2>
<p>I purchased the exam through Microsoft with a voucher for a month's access to the MeasureUp.com test exams.</p>
<p>I found multiple issues with their test exams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions that ask you for two answers, but then mark you down for not answering 3</li>
<li>Answers that were plain wrong ! (e.g. It claims Web Jobs can't use Powershell scripts)</li>
<li>Questions and Answers with inconsistent data (e.g. different IP addresses between the question and correct answer)</li>
<li>Lots of pretty outdated questions around things like Cloud Roles</li>
<li>Links to blog articles from 2014 that are hopelessly out of date</li>
<li>Versions of services that don't exist anymore, or are depreciated (lots of the old AD sync stuff)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even logging on was problematic !</p>
<p>Very frustrating, but in the end I was glad I used them, just to get use to the format of the questions, and the explanations of the answers are reasonable good.  Just double check anything that doesn't ring true !</p>
<h2 id="on-the-day">On the day</h2>
<p>One thing to get into the habit of: don't think of the questions as you would in real-life with all the complex requirements and tradeoffs, think what is the correct answer given the very minimal info in the question they have given you.</p>
<p>This took me a while, but you just need
to answer how Microsoft want you to answer, not necessarily what you would do in a real situation.</p>
<p>The exam was 2.5 hours, but I finished within 1.5.  Be aware some questions allow you to go back and review, but some do not.</p>
<p>I'm not allowed to go into details on any of the questions, but here are the subjects that I remember coming up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security Centre, Security Policies (lots of security and encryption questions)</li>
<li>Cognitive services</li>
<li>CosmoDB</li>
<li>On prem to Azure networking</li>
<li>Azure storage</li>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Service Levels of Redis</li>
<li>Routers ( Traffic Manager, Load Balancer, Application Gateway )</li>
<li>Data factory, Logic apps, Function apps</li>
<li>Batch</li>
<li>AD authorisation</li>
<li>Web jobs</li>
<li>Queue types and which to use - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/events-data-points-and-messages-choosing-the-right-azure-messaging-service-for-your-data/">read this</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I don't remember many questions of the following (but your mileage may vary):</p>
<ul>
<li>Sql Server (except TDE)</li>
<li>VM types</li>
<li>API management</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck !</p>
